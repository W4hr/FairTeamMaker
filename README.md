# FairTeamMaker ⚖️

![Project Logo](#) <!-- Placeholder for your logo -->

FairTeamMaker is a web app designed to create **balanced teams** using **player scores** and **relationships**. With algorithms like brute force and greedy, it ensures fairness by balancing both skill levels and interpersonal dynamics.

## Features ✨

- **Balanced Team Creation** using multiple algorithms.
- **Player-to-Player Impact** adjustments.
- **Score Normalization** via sigmoid function.
- **Secure** JWT authentication and HTTPS.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. Input player scores and relationships.
2. Choose an algorithm.
3. Get balanced teams with score and interaction analysis.
